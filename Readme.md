## üìö | Problem Statement

-Develop a TODO API using Golang and ScyllaDB that supports basic CRUD operations and
includes pagination functionality for the list endpoint.
Requirements
‚óè Set up a Golang project and integrate ScyllaDB as the database for storing TODO items.
Ensure that items in the database are stored user-wise.
‚óè Implement endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting TODO items for a
single user at a time. Each TODO item should have at least the following properties: id,
user_id, title, description, status, created, updated.
‚óè Implement a paginated list endpoint to retrieve TODO items.
‚óè Provide support for filtering based on TODO item status (e.g., pending, completed).

## üåê | Test Project

- Clone this repository.
- Install Docker Desktop.
- Run `docker-compose build` in the root directory of the project. This process takes a a minute or two to complete, for the first time.
- Run `docker-compose up ` to initialize a Scylla-DB instance running on port 9042.
- Go from the main directory to `\cmd\todo-api` and then run `go run main.go` to start the service.

### Features Implemented:

- Implemented CRUD routes for interaction b/w server and ScyllaDB.
- The API's are paginated for easy data retrieval.
- The application's DB part is Dockerized and is stateful through volumes.
- Support for filtering based on TODO item status (e.g., pending, completed).

### Current Architecture:

- Containerized approach to solving the problem statement.
- Two Interfaces one for the server and one for db are interacting b/w each other for the backend application.

### Future Scope:

- The current architecture is a very basic implementation of the problem statement.
- Depending upon the scale, the entire architecture can be **scaled horizontally** using nginx load balancing.
- Web can use a queueing mechanism like Rabbit or BullMQ to introduce pub-sub architecture to improve performance.
- The Go-Server could be containerized to improve deployment.
- Introduction to goroutines would increase the overall throughput of the service.
